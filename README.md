# automateJunitTestCaseCSE2231
This program is designed to automate test cases. So that the input can be fluid, the program assumes a few key identifiers that determine where input needs to be changed. Additionally String is used as the primary storage method so test cases that have more than Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2 characters will not be able to replicate.
